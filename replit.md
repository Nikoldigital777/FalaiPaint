# SDXL Lifestyle Photography Pipeline

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application for AI-powered lifestyle photography generation. It enables photographers to generate photorealistic human figures in existing background scenes using advanced AI models including SDXL Inpainting, ControlNet, and LoRA. The system is designed for Carlos San Juan's lifestyle photography workflow, allowing seamless integration of AI-generated subjects into real background photographs while maintaining photographic quality and consistency.

The application provides a complete pipeline from asset upload through generation to quality assessment, with real-time progress tracking and comprehensive metrics reporting.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React with TypeScript**: Modern component-based UI built with React 18 and TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: Utility-first styling with a comprehensive component library for consistent design
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool optimized for modern web development
- **TanStack Query**: Robust data fetching and caching with automatic background updates and error handling
- **Wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing solution

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js**: RESTful API server with middleware for request logging and error handling
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety across the entire application stack
- **In-Memory Storage**: Simple storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **Multer**: File upload handling with validation and size limits for image assets

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit configured for PostgreSQL with schema-first approach
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing projects, variants, and quality metrics
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider for scalable cloud hosting
- **File Storage**: Local file system for development with support for external storage services

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Session-based Authentication**: Uses connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **File Access Control**: CORS-enabled file serving with appropriate security headers
